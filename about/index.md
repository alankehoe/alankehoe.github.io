I am a DCU graduate (computer applications), I have a passion for software development with a particular 
interest in building full stack web applications. I have experience working with 
Java, Ruby, Python, SQL, Javascript, Bash, TDD. I also have some experience working with Linux administration 
and virtualisation. My final year project was a Fleet management and tracking application which used AngularJS, 
Ruby on Rails and Android and prior to that my third year project was a open source car computer / logging tool which 
used python to read serial data from a cars diagnostic port.
